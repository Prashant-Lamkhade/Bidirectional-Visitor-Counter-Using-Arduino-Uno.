ðŸ“Š Bidirectional Visitor Counter Using Arduino Uno
This project, completed during my SYBSc in Computer Science, is a hardware-based system that automatically counts the number of people entering and exiting a room using infrared (IR) sensors and an Arduino Uno microcontroller. The system uses two IR sensors placed at the entrance to detect movement directionâ€”incrementing the counter when someone enters and decrementing it when someone exits. The visitor count is displayed in real-time on a 16x2 LCD display.

The project highlights the practical application of embedded systems and sensor integration, combining digital logic with real-world interaction. It also lays a foundation in microcontroller programming using the Arduino IDE and demonstrates basic automation principles.
